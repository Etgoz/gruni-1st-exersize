            <img src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/411hVDS5mWL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_FMwebp_.jpg' alt="A man called ove book cover image"/>

                <b>Abstract:</b> <br />
                Ove is a curmudgeon—the kind of man who points at people he dislikes 
                as if they were burglars caught outside his bedroom window. He has staunch principles, 
                strict routines, and a short fuse. People call him “the bitter neighbor from hell.” 
                But must Ove be bitter just because he doesn’t walk around with a smile plastered to his face all the time?
                <br />
                Behind the cranky exterior there is a story and a sadness.
                So when one November morning a chatty young couple with two chatty young daughters move in 
                next door and accidentally flatten Ove’s mailbox, it is the lead-in to a comical and heartwarming 
                tale of unkempt cats, unexpected friendship, and the ancient art of backing up a U-Haul. 
                All of which will change one cranky old man and a local residents’ association to their very foundations.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like the book because it is really well written. The characters are very relateable and the story is both funny 
                and sad and very touching
            </p>
            <q>
                We always think there's enough time to do things with other people. 
                Time to say things to them. And then something happens and then we stand there holding on to words like 'if'.

            <h2>A place I enjoyed visiting - Isla Holbox, Quintana Roo, Mexico</h2>
            <p>
                Holbox is a small island in the north-east end of mexico. The island is accessed by ferry from the mainland town of Chiquilá, 
                and has virtually no cars, with transport by most residents and tourists by golf cart or moped. 
                Holbox is very quiet and relaxed place and it has beautiful beaches and wilderness.
            </p>
